# Software
#### Multimodal Medical Imaging Analysis by AI
- [**PathoSig**](https://github.com/ZhouSunLab-Workshops/PathoSig) &nbsp;
Histopathology images-based deep learning prediction of prognosis and therapeutic response in small cell lung cancer.
- [**DeepDrAMD**](https://github.com/ZhouSunLab-Workshops/DeepDrAMD) &nbsp;
Deep learning model on color fundus photographs for early detection AMD performance, classifying dryAMD and wetAMD and distinguish wetAMD type1 or type2 notification.
- [**DeepDrRVO**](https://github.com/ZhouSunLab-Workshops/DeepDrRVO) &nbsp;
Deep learning model on color fundus photographs for early recognition and differential diagnosis of retinal vascular occlusion.

#### Computational Biology and Precision Medicine Model
- [**CCML**](https://github.com/ZhouSunLab-Workshops/ccml) &nbsp;
A two-step consensus clustering inputing multiple predictive labels with different sample coverages (missing labels) 
- [**MLMRP**](https://github.com/ZhouSunLab-Workshops/MLMRP) &nbsp;
All code for a multi-lncRNA diagnostic signature (MLMRPscore) for ESCC.
- [**CCI**](https://github.com/ZhouSunLab-Workshops/CCI) &nbsp;
CCI using machine learning method as a personalized prognosticator of immune subtyping which could accurately predict the survival and therapeutic response of SCLC patients in multicenter bulk transcriptomic data cohorts and immunohistochemistry cohorts.
- [**MODeepHRD**](https://github.com/ZhouSunLab-Workshops/MODeepHRD) &nbsp;
Multi-Omics integrative Deep-learning framework for HRD-positive phenotype detection. The MODeepHRD utilized a convolutional attention autoencoder that can leverage omics-specific and cross-omics complementary knowledge learning.
- [**iUMRG**](https://github.com/ZhouSunLab-Workshops/iUMRG) &nbsp;
Multi-layered network-guided propagation modeling for the inference of susceptibility genes in uveal melanoma.
